DEJA IS A WORK IN PROGRESS! CAREFUL NOW!

deja is a node.js-driven CLI utility for managing the git versioning of home
directory sundries, such as dotfiles and scripts.

If you have a Git repository containing your dotfiles, for example, you can
clone this repo and add symlinks in your home directory to the items in it
using something like:

    deja clone git@github.com:mcantelon/dotfiles.git

To update this repo you'd enter:

    deja pull dotfiles.git

So see what repos you've cloned, enter:

   deja ls

More commands coming soon.
